# Book Graph Analyzer

**Transform novels into queryable knowledge graphs, style fingerprints, and world bibles.**

Built for writers who want to deeply understand an author's craft—not just *what* they wrote, but *how* they wrote it, and the invisible rules that make their worlds feel real.

## The Vision

Feed this system an author's complete works. It extracts:

- **Knowledge Graph**: Every character, place, object, and event—and how they connect
- **Style Fingerprint**: Sentence patterns, vocabulary choices, pacing, descriptive tendencies
- **Character Voices**: How each character speaks, their verbal tics, formality levels
- **World Bible**: The unwritten rules—how magic works, cultural norms, what's possible

Then use all of this to write new stories that feel authentically *in that world and voice*.

## Primary Use Case

Tolkien fan fiction. We're starting with the complete legendarium:
- The Hobbit
- The Lord of the Rings
- The Silmarillion
- Unfinished Tales
- The History of Middle-earth (as available)

But the system is designed to work with any author's corpus.
